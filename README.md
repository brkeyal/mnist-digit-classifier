# MNIST Digit Classifier with GUI

This Python application allows users to **train**, **save**, **load**, and **use** a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It features a user-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with **Tkinter**, enabling users to:

1. **Input Hyperparameters**: Specify learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
2. **Train the Model**: Initiate training based on the provided hyperparameters.
3. **Save/Load Models**: Save trained models to disk and load existing models for inference.
4. **Draw & Classify**: Draw a digit in a canvas and classify it using the trained model, displaying both the predicted digit and the probability distribution across all classes.
